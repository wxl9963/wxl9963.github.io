I am a MD candidate in General Surgery with a focus on Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery at Peking University First Hospital, Peking University Health Science Center. Born in December 1997 in Henan Province, China, I completed my undergraduate studies at Jiangsu University (Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province) in 2022, where I obtained my Bachelor's degree.

In 2022, I successfully passed the postgraduate entrance examination and was admitted to Peking University Health Science Center, pursuing a professional Master's degree in Surgery at Peking University First Hospital. In 2025, I passed the internal doctoral transfer examination and continued my studies as a professional Doctoral candidate in Surgery at the same institution.

My research focuses on both clinical and basic studies in hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases, with particular interests in minimally invasive surgical techniques and perioperative management optimization.
