## Academic Background
Born in December 1997 in Henan Province, China, I have a solid academic trajectory focused on medical research and clinical practice:
- **2025–Present**: Professional Doctoral Candidate in Surgery (General Surgery, Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery Subspecialty) at Peking University First Hospital, Peking University Health Science Center.
- **2022–2025**: Professional Master’s Candidate in Surgery at Peking University First Hospital, Peking University Health Science Center (admitted via postgraduate entrance examination in 2022).
- **2018–2022**: Undergraduate Student at Jiangsu University (Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province), obtained Bachelor’s Degree in Medicine.


## Research Focus
My research centers on **clinical and basic studies of hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases**, with two core directions:
1. Minimally invasive surgical techniques for hepatobiliary and pancreatic disorders (e.g., laparoscopic resection, robotic-assisted surgery).
2. Optimization of perioperative management (e.g., risk assessment for high-risk patients, accelerated rehabilitation after surgery).

I aim to bridge basic research findings with clinical practice, improving treatment efficacy and patient prognosis.


## Academic Interests
Beyond my core research, I am also interested in:
- Medical education and training for young surgeons.
- Application of artificial intelligence in surgical outcome prediction.
- International academic exchanges in hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery.
